# Tasks

### Task 1: Lock-ins

In this week's course material, you might have heard about concept of lock-ins, often differentiated into **technological** and **vendor lock-ins**. Provide a brief summary of each type of lock-in. Feel free to share any personal insights you may have regarding your own experiences with these lock-ins. Additionally, discuss the potential costs associated with breaking free from these lock-ins and the advantages and disadvantages of remaining within them.

aim for around 150-200 words in your answer and list sources used.

Answer:

The main idea of technological lock-in, is that technologies and systems make you follow certain paths, which are difficult and costly to escape. One big example I found on this, are QWERTY keyboards, but one that is probably more relevant is Carbon lock-in. This means that we as a society have become so accustomed to rely on carbon, that it is hard and costly to move forward from it.

The vendor lock-in makes the customer reliant on the brand or a product, and makes it hard and costly for them to change the vendor, for example the Apple Ecosystem, not that I would even want to leave it. But if I wanted to, it would be hard and costly for me to get the same experience I get with my phone, headphones and watch working seamlessly.

### Task2: Security Psychology

Familiarize yourself with definitions for following; cognitive-, behavioral- and social psychology, course material and search engines are your friends!
using one or multiple of them, explain your rationale for following phenomena:
- why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?
- why social engineering works on people?
- why many people have hard time using  passwords in secure way?
- why PGP fails to be effective way to secure email?
- why it is so easy to spread malware?

no strict length requirements, but aim for 100+ words per question.

Answers:

- The biggest thing about phising attacks for TA's are that they are cost effective. It's fairly easy to perform phishing attacks and spam them as a campaing towards companies, and because most people are poorly educated and the phishings are evolving, so many people get caught in them and get their credentials stolen, often without even them knowing it, because AiTM attacks are so popular now.
Also, phishing attacks are easy to snowball for the threat actors, because if you get a hold of one account in a company, you can use it to for eg. send emails from seemingly trusted source to your companys customers for example, and then they get caught in it and so on.

- Social engineering works on people, because we are human, and if you don't know better, you are often easily manipulated. Behavioural concepts like trust and good manners are things that 
attackers exploit, and thats just what is usually the most vulnerable thing in a big company. 

- Probably because they have chosen a one password when they were young, and then used it to every possible place before realizing that its bad practice. Then you suddenly have 50 login credentials with the same-ish password and it is just too much of work to change them all up. 

- PGP fails because:

    It's not practical. Managing and distributing your public and private keys is a bit hassle for an email. 

    It's not perfect, since it only encrypts the contents, but not the metadata. This means there would be tons of information availiable, suchs as sender/recipient, subjects, routing and so on.

    If your private key gets leaked, it's hard to revoke that.

    No recovery mechanisms for lost keys. This means that data can be lost. 

- Spreading malware is fairly easy because we have become so accustomed to clicking on links without checking them too much. Altough modern AV "even" on windows is quite good on my own experience and you should be good if you keep your systems up to date. For example when experimenting with LockBits ransomware, it was hard to even get it downloaded, since Windows defender caught it instantly, so I had to have AV disabled to get the machine to into ransomwared-state.

## Task 3:

### Task3A: Intellectual Rights

Companies prioritize safeguarding their assets, encompassing both tangible and intangible aspects. This protection involves utilizing legal mechanisms like: 

- intellectual property (IP)
- copyright
- patent
- trademark
- Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)

along with employing technologies such as:

- watermarks
- software licenses
- digital rights management (DRM)
- software protection dongles

Please provide a brief explanation of each mentioned safeguarding method and cite any known use cases for each.

### Task3B: Freedom of Information

Other side of the coin, information wants to be free. Pick 2 safeguarding methods from previous part and Investigate and present real-world instances where the aforementioned safeguarding methods were bypassed, highlighting entities involved and the rationale behind their actions. Additionally, report on how they justify these circumventions. Answer in 400-500 word essay.

> Please note the part, 'virtual machine & docker' will have most focus on the first exercise session.

### Virtual Machine Setup: Virtual Machine with Docker

You should setup the courses virtual machine and get it ready with docker working. This weeks exercise session will focus on this. 

- Download the course virtual machine from https://ouspg.org/archlinux/.

- Set it up in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), install if it is not yet installed. You should set it up with no more than 4 cores, less than or around half of system RAM, around 30 GBs of space should be good and for future use make sure it can use USB. (Defaults: 4 cores, 4gb ram, 30gb storage)

- Credentials for the machine are 'arch/arch'

- Update keyring in console with ```sudo pacman -S archlinux-keyring```

- Update system with ```sudo pacman -Syu```

- Test Docker with ```docker run hello-world```

# Tasks

### Task 1: What measures have you taken to protect yourself from cyber crimes?

Write a short description of the actions you have done to fortify your defenses towards all sorts of cyber crimes, including possible servers and accounts you have. Please keep in mind not to include any specific details, such as passwords or tokens.

Have you been a victim of cyber crimes and do you think you could have prevented them? For example phishing and malware attacks. What could you improve on?

Please keep your answer concise, bullet points are acceptable, but remember to answer atleast all mentioned topics.

ANSWERS:

I use password managers, MFAs, keep my system up to date to ensure best antivirus possible.

### Task 2: Company Security Policy
Pick two topics from the list below to write a security policy on.
An effort should be made to include one policy on one A4 page. 

<details>
<summary>Topics</summary>
<br>

- Password policy
- Physical access policy
- Cloud usage/security policy
- System authentication policy
- Network perimeter security policy
- Social media security policy
- BYOD(Bring Your Own Device) policy
- General purpose information security policy

</details>

These policies are to be kept quite straight-forward and easily understandable for any employee, this includes explaining certain not well-known topics, for example a VPN or a network perimeter. The second lecture "Threat Models and Security Policies" gives very good advice on how to write sensible policies.

You should also check [this](https://csrc.nist.rip/publications/nistpubs/800-12/800-12-html/chapter5.html) for detailed advice and explanation on for example types of policies. For example chapter 5.2.2 gives good insight on what basic components are good for issue-specific policies.
You don't have to contain yourself to just text, you may include for example pictures and data-flow charts where beneficial.

Answers:

Password policy:

- Every employee must have Bitlocker on their endpoint to ensure the safety if the device is stolen.

- Employees also must use password manager, that creates and manages passwords, that are atleast 16 characters long, contains a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and special characters.

- Passwords must be changed every 3 months, by the password manager.


Physical access policy: 

- Every emplyoyee must wear a badge when inside the offices.

- Every employee must let themselves in. (No holding the door for the next person).

- Guests must go trough helpdesk and not leave unsupervised in areas only designated for employees.

### Task 3: Threat Modelling

Recommended to check out this very tight package on threat modelling. [The privacyguides' threat modelling info package.](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/threat-modeling/) 

<details>
<summary>Here's the essential points you can find in the above link:</summary>
<br>

- Identify your assets. WHAT do you want to protect? 

- Who are your potential adversaries. WHO do you want to protect from? 

- Assess the threats and likelyhoods of them for each of your assets. How LIKELY is it that you will need to protect it? 

- Evaluate impact if an asset is compromised. How bad are the CONSEQUENCES if you fail? 

- Cost. How much trouble and time are you willing to spend to prevent the consequences? 

- Mitigate or mitigation plan; determine what you can do now and what to do if compromised. 

</details>

### Task 3A: [Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/) 

Threat Dragon is an OSS tool used to create threat model diagrams(see image below). The tool very specifically does **not** try to do too much on its own, rather gives control to the user and encourages their own thinking, as they should thoroughly analyse the system they are working on. 

In this task we are using the second version, it's documentation is [here](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/docs-2/install-options/). You may use your preferred method for installation, they are very similar, but we recommend **the desktop application,** as it stores the models on the local file system. First go through a bit of the documentation to get acquainted with the tool. Then you will be analysing a ready made flawed model, and you should find pain points and fix the model. The model is *"Student_website_Threat_Model.json"* in the threat dragon repository, there you will also find an example of how the report looks like without threats. Below you will find minimum requirements and a system description. 

<details>
<summary>Minimun requirements for the point:</summary>
<br>

Each **missing** or **incomplete** main point deducts 0.1 from this part.

- Created at least 10 threats 
    - Use STRIDE with approriate categories
- Mitigated at least 5 threats 
    - Must include how mitigated 
- Named yourself as the reviewer 
- Exported report as PDF and uploaded to github
- Gave feedback on this task on your github page 

</details>

<details>
<summary>System description:</summary>
<br>

The model is of a static student portfolio website with the following attributes: 

- HTML5 and CSS 
- Containerized with docker, Nginx
- Cloud hosted, student rents server
- Local development, connect via SSH 

</details>


ANSWER:
 DONE, PDF in the folder. 


### Task 3B: Personal Threat Model

A threat model is a tool used widely in security, it can be used for example to identify sensitive or vulnerable data or systems. Its goal is to identify potential vulnerabilities and a likely impact of a security breach, helping companies take proper measures to mitigate and / or prevent these. A threat model can also help companies assess and prioritize its security efforts by identifying which assets are the most critical and which threats are the most probable. Overall, a threat model is a vital part of a comprehensive cyber security strategy helping organizations manage risks and breaches, and how to allocate defense budget.

In this task we are focusing solely on the cyber side of threat models as you will be creating a personal threat model to identify and assess potential threats to your assets, for example sensitive information and online accounts.

The goal of creating a personal threat model is to help you understand potential ways to analyze your own cyber behavior and how to prioritize your efforts regarding your own personal security and privacy. It is also important for cyber security students to understand the types of threats they may face and what the potential impact can be. Threat modelling is also an important skill for security professionals and doing personal threat modelling can be translatable to real world businesses.

You can find more information on [OWASP Threat modelling,](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling) in [The Threat Modelling Manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/) and [Privacyguides' threat modelling](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/threat-modeling/)


We also recommend creating a visual representation(s) of your threat model(for example threat dragon), diagrams and flowcharts are good for this. Discussing with your classmates can also help with any additional measures you can take to reduce your risks.

### Task 4: Personal Security Audit

### Task 4A: Network scan 

Let's start with a network scan, [NMAP](https://nmap.org/); a network mapper which is 
> "A free and open source utility for network exploration and security auditing" -[NMAP Book](https://nmap.org/book/preface.html) 

NMAP is available as both a CLI and [GUI (Zenmap)](https://nmap.org/zenmap/) application, most of the time you will use nmap from the command line. There are some benefits to Zenmap, such as the topology map, and we are going to showcase that here in this task. 

NMAP is available on all the commmon platforms and you can get it from their [website](https://nmap.org/download), however if you are using Linux, you can most likely get it from your package manager. Go ahead and proceed with the installation, for Linux you might have to install Zenmap package as it usually is not bundled with NMAP. If you are using Windows we recommend leaving everything as default.

>**Note**
>Before scanning your network, make sure to let everyone on the network know about it, and more importantly give them the ability to disconnect their devices. 

To scan your network you are going to need your ip address in CIDR notation, which will most likely look something like this: ```192.168.1.0/24```. Below you will find instruction for Linux, Windows and Mac.

<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

The command ```ip a``` will show your ip address already in CIDR notation, you just have to find the address of the correct device, usually the second from the top as the first will be localhost. 

![ip a on Linux](https://github.com/ouspg/SecurityEngineering/blob/main/Week1_Threats/Images/Linux_ip_a.png)

Now make sure to swap the host part; part after the last '.' and before the '/' to a 0. Add the CIDR and this will be the address you will scan.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

The command ipconfig will show you your ip address and the subnet mask, with these we will figure out the address you will scan.

![ipconfig on windows](https://github.com/ouspg/SecurityEngineering/blob/main/Week1_Threats/Images/Windows_ipconfig.PNG)

These are the numbers we care about.

The most common subnet mask in home networks is ```255.255.255.0``` this will result in '/24' at the end of the ip address. If your subnet mask is something else, please refer to this [cheat sheet](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/subnet-cheat-sheet-24-subnet-mask-30-26-27-29-and-other-ip-address-cidr-network-references/) to find out your CIDR notated address.

Now make sure to swap the host part of your ip address; part after the last '.' to a 0. Add the CIDR and this will the address you will scan. 

</details>

Now that we have the address we want to scan, open up Zenmap. The UI is mostly self-explanatory, put the ip address in CIDR notation to the target and choose intense scan for the profile, then just press scan. This should scan the devices in your network. While the scan is running, you can see the output the same way as in NMAP, wait for it to finish and comb through the output. Take note of open ports, scripts and operating systems the scan found.

Make your way over to the topology tab. Enable easy controls with the control button on the left. Here you should now see all the devices found, icon definitions can be seen after clicking the 'Legend' button on the right, and more info on the devices can be found by right clicking.

Save the scan with ```CTRL + S``` and take a screenshot of this topology screen with devices clearly visible, you can redact device information from the screenshot if you want to. 

>The topology map can show traceroutes when scanning outside your network, this is where the tool shines as a simple visual aid. 

**What to return:**
1. Did you find devices you did not know were in your network?
2. Were there open ports which should have been closed?
3. Did nmap find any vulnerabilities with the scripts?
4. Screenshot of the topology of your network. You can redact device information if you want.

Answers:

No, I didn't find devices that i didnt know about.
No there wasnt open ports.
It didnt find any vulnerabilities.
Screenshot is in the folder.

### Task 4B: Account Security

This part of task 4 is to check yourself with haveibeenpwned. This should let you know if your account details have been leaked and what types of information was included.

[Haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) Is a website and very simple to use, you input your email address and it will search for leaks on platforms where you have accounts. The website shows you platforms it detected had been leaked and those leaks included your email address, however it is not a definitive list and there may be more leaks or dumps with your email included. Take a screenshot for the return. 

**What to return:**
1. Has your account details leaked?
2. Screenshot of haveibeenpwned search, you can redact information if you want.
3. Did you change passwords and/or email + password combos, that were leaked, if not, do it.

Answers:
They havent got leaked.
Screenshot in the folder. I wasnt pwned though.
Nothing was leaked. 

### Feedback
Be sure to give feedback on these tasks. Do you feel these to be the kind of skills you might need or want?

I feel like more practical stuff could be included.
